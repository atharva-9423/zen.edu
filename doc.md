LearnHub follows a **less-is-more** approach. We believe that the environment you learn in should be as clean as the code you write. 

- **Typography**: Focused on readability with the *Inter* font family.
- **Interactions**: Smooth modal transitions and intuitive filtering.
- **Architecture**: No bloat. Pure HTML, CSS, and JS.
